# mineos-node Patch

Several methods exist to add the extra profile.

1. minecraftbedrockwrapper.js - place this in mineos-node/profiles.d prior to compilation

2. profiles.d.patch - a patch file version of 1 if preferred

3. profiles.js.patch - a patch for a compiled mineos-node against /usr/games/minecraft/profiles.js. Patch and restart the mineos service.
