# MineOS Bedrock Wrapper
A Java jar wrapper for the official Minecraft Linux Bedrock Server 

https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock

This functionality is now available in MineOS v1.2.1+


Preamble
--------
My children asked to play Bedrock latest edition with their friends. With Java edition, I host on my MineOS server. 
NukkitX is one available Bedrock profile (and looks to be really well supported, you should check it out) but it was behind the official release.
So I thought laterally.. if I wrapped the official release in a jar, it's reasonably compatible with MineOS expectations and supports stop, etc.,
and here we are...


Usage
-----

Upgrade to MineOS v1.2.1+


**Play Bedrock. Enjoy.**
